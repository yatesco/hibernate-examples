# Introduction #

This wiki page details how to setup a developer workstation.

# Details #

The IDE of choice is Eclipse, build system is Ant and dependency management is performed by ivy.

Once you have checked out the project, you must first use ant and ivy to pull in all the dependencies.  Simply execute "ant retrieve" in the appropriate project.

Secondly, create a new workspace in Eclipse, and then import existing projects.

Er, that's it :)
